K23: Foundations 6
30-11-2022

QCC:
- The documentation for Foundations 6 is VERY similar to Bootstrap. You may find it's use of classes very familiar.
- Classes "h1 h2 h3" are like the built in h1, h2, h3 in HTML, except they are scalable.
- Classes callout, primary/alert/success are like Bootstrap, producing callouts.
- Classes clear rounded hollow are used for buttons, much like callouts.
