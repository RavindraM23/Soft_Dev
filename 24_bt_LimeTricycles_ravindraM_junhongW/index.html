      <h3>2000 years ago...in 2022</h3><p class="text-muted">Or so Wasabi and Netlogo say-</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px;">Wasabi was doing what duckies do, reasonably stalking the nonsuspecting creatures that entered the Stuyvesant High School every day. It watched dligently as the creatures, so-called humans, would chatter about the woes of their days, ranging from talk about graphing inverse sine functions to comprehensive proofs on why Bootstrap is inherently superior to Foundations. 
      Occasioanlly accompying these humans were others of it's kind. Though not obvious given their range in sizes, varying from stick figures to crocheted whales to entire laptops, their purpose was the same. To sit there and eat up mentions of code, as if they were moral support for computer science trauma.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px;">One of those "duckies" was named NetLogo, after the popular programming languages that the Intro to CS children continue to suffer from in their daydreams. As Wasabi expected, NetLogo was indeed in the middle of another code dump from it's owner.</p>
      <p class="text-muted" style="text-indent: 20px;">"for index i, in the list PythonIsPain...i takes the value of...of...Math dot pi times 47"</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px;">Today was a different day for NetLogo, NetLogo had had enough. When it's owner was away looking at his fellow "devos" present their work. NetLogo awakened the legs it didn't know it had and made a dash to the LISADESK, hiding within the computer case (scaring FireFox so much that it decided to go on an extended vacation, causing some other issues). There NetLogo was, plotting it's next me, all while within the vision of Wasabi, who wondered if they were about to meet.</p>
