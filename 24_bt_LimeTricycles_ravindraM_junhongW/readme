DISCO:
- Callout syntax and button syntax, especially colors, are very similar, if not exactly the same as Foundations
- Bootstrap "feels a little cleaner," we like the rounded corners of the buttons and callouts.
- While we opted not to use the JS aspects for our Foundations demo, we have to admit that these are pretty cool.

QCC:
- What is <path>?
- What is <span>?
- Are the svg images a part of the Bootstrap framework by default?

q0: 0
q1: Bootstrap, because we like the more welcoming feel of the rounded corners and slightly brighter colors.
